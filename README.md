# Mesh Creation for SWASH

Package to automatically transform swash input files given in cartesian coordinates to an unstructured mesh produced by gmsh. Points of interest may be specified to increase resolution near them.

## Future Work
- Adapt this package to use parameters given as function or cli arguments instead of reading the SWASH input file so it's usable with any program
